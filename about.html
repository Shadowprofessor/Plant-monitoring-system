        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>The primary goal of this project is to design and implement an advanced IoT-based system that captures and efficiently utilizes the bio-electricity generated from living plants.
            This innovative approach taps into the natural metabolic processes of plants, enabling the extraction of small amounts of energy, which will be harvested using specially designed bio-electrodes. The collected energy will be stored in capacitors or small batteries and subsequently used to power low-energy devices such as environmental sensors, small LEDs, or other IoT components.</p>
        <h3>TEAM AIM FOR PROJECT</h3>
            <h4>OUR TEAM 18 received the exciting opportunity to work on a project that focuses on creating a working prototype for generating electricity from plants. In this first year, our goal is to demonstrate how living plants, which already contribute to our lives by providing food, shelter, and wood, can also support us in producing clean, renewable energy.
            Traditionally, humans have exploited plants by cutting them down for resources. However, with this innovative approach, we no longer need to harm plants for their benefits. 
            Instead, they will continue to thrive and contribute to the reduction of our reliance on coal, petrol, and other non-renewable resources. By using plants to generate electricity, we can support efforts to combat climate change, preserve natural ecosystems, and reduce environmental degradation.
            Our project also emphasizes plant health. We are committed to ensuring that this process does not harm the plants in any way. By using IoT technology, we will monitor the plant's condition in real-time, tracking energy production and ensuring that the plants remain healthy and unharmed throughout the process.
